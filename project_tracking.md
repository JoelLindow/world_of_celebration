# Project Tracking
I opted to use this as a tracking system, rather than use Waffle.io or Pivotal Tracker, just so I could showcase the fact that work was broken into small chunks and tested as opposed to just "hacking away". Typically, I would use some sort of "card management software" to track and manage workflow of a project.
